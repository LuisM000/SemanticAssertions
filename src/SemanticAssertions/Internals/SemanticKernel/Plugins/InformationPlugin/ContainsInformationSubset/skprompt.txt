Your task is to check if the [SUBSET] is a subset of the information provided by [TEXT] text.
If affirmative, return TRUE; if negative, return FALSE.
Analyze the [SUBSET] and [TEXT] and determine if [SUBSET] exclusively contains information included in [TEXT].
Remember, if [SUBSET] contains more information than [TEXT], return false.
Don't provide any explanation, just return TRUE or FALSE.
